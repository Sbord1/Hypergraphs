=========================================
  [+] Added, [-] Fixed, [*] Changed
=========================================

=========================================
2008-12-07 TpX Version 1.5
=========================================

[-] Command line export to latexsrc and pdflatexsrc
 did not add '.tex' extension to output file name.

[-] A bug in undo for freehand lines.

[-] Grouped objects lost their parent drawing (arrow-heads were 
 drawn incorrectly for objects in a group),

[-] Table editor in the "Edit coordinates" window was too narrow
 leading sometimes to disappearance of table columns.

=========================================
2008-11-17 TpX Version 1.5 beta 2
=========================================

[-] Fixed problems with TeXLive.

[-] There was a bug which caused TpX not to load the new
 document properties at program start.

[+] preview.tex.inc was simplified. TpX now adds the packages it
 needs automatically. Unneeded packages are not added now
 to preview document.

[*] MetaPost output does not use \textcolor in TeX text anymore.

[-] preserveAspectRatio='none' was not added when needed while
 writing bitmap to SVG.

[+] Freehand-drawn Bezier path is created with current properties 
 applied to it.

=========================================
2008-11-09 TpX Version 1.5 beta 
=========================================

[+] Now it is possible to use the default font size of the parent 
 LaTeX document by setting FontSizeInTeX property to 0
 (\fontsize...\selectfont would not be added to LaTeX code).

[-] PicMagnif was not taken into account when setting
 font size in MetaPost

[*] Lua module for generating TpX files (lTpX)
 replaced the old Python module (TpXpy)

[*] New version of TpX file format, version 5. Treatment
 of dotted lines has changed incompatibly (see below).

[*] Vertical alignment of text proved to be unreliable
 and hard to be made compatible across devices. 
 All text labels are now baseline aligned.

 using toolbar (for all selected objects at once):
 arrow-heads, text labels, stars.

[-] WinEdt command in 'TpX_menu.dat' fixed to work correctly in 
 "soft breaks" regime

 (if drawing has changed)

 transformation operations

 When loading old TpX files the width of dotted lines is
 adjusted to make them somewhat more similar to the previous
 appearance.

[+*] Freehand Bezier curve instead of freehand polyline

[+] "Delete small objects" operation

[-] Fixed latexeps, latexpdf and latexcustom export for 
pgf/tikz (images were too wide in some situations)
